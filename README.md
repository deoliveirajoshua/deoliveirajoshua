I’m a PhD candidate at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) in the [DAISY Lab](https://daisy.wpi.edu/), advised by Professor Elke Rundensteiner. Prior to my PhD, I earned B.S. degrees in computer science and data science at WPI. For more info, check out my [personal website](https://deoliveirajoshua.github.io/).

## Research Interests
My research is on **Deep Learning Optimization**, with a focus on discovering ways to understand the dynamics of how neural networks learn during training. You can view the full list of my publications on my [Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lTSG7qQAAAAJ).
