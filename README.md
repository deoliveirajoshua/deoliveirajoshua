## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Research Interests
My research is on **Deep Learning Optimization**, with a focus on discovering ways to understand the dynamics of how neural networks learn during training.

## Bio
Iâ€™m a PhD candidate at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) in the [DAISY Lab](https://daisy.wpi.edu/), advised by Professor Elke Rundensteiner. Prior to my PhD, I earned B.S. degrees in computer science and data science at WPI.
